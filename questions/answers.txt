Question 2:

Hi Carrie,

Thank you for reaching out.

We apologize for any issues that you have endured while using our platform. The best solution
for the problem that you are currently facing is to reduce the size of your records.
Please note there are two main ways to do this:

1) If there is any data that is not necessary for your search, it would be safe to remove
those records from Algolia. Please follow the link below to read more about this:
https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/how-to/indexing-long-documents/

2) The second solution to reducing the size of your records is to split them into smaller chunks
   by using Aloglia's distinct feature to only portray the best result. You can read more about this
   here: https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/how-to/indexing-long-documents/

Please note that if you need to upgrade your plan to search for bigger objects you can contact us at 
enterprise@algolia.com. In the meantime, if you need anything else, please let us know.

Best,
Keith Brien


Question 3:

Hi Marc,

Thank you for reaching out.

You are seeing that error because you have either not defined searchkit before
using it in your code, or you did not import it correctly before using it in your code.
If the problem still persists , please do not hesitate to reach out again!

Best,
Keith Brien
